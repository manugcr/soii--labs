# The Luck is on Our Side

[![Minimal QA Workflow](https://github.com/ICOMP-UNC/cannyEdgeFilter/actions/workflows/StyleAndDoc.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ICOMP-UNC/cannyEdgeFilter/actions/workflows/StyleAndDoc.yml)

## üéØ Objectives

- **Develop a C++ library** that encapsulates the complexity of the Canny edge detection algorithm, providing a high-performance tool for image processing tasks.

## üìù Evaluation Aspects

1. **Code Quality and Organization**: Code should be well-organized, commented, and adhere to modern C++ standards (C++17 and above).
2. **Functionality**: All functions must perform as specified, robustly processing images to detect edges.
3. **Robustness**: The application must efficiently handle large images and ensure accurate edge detection under varying conditions without crashing.
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation must be provided, detailing how to use the library and the underlying design choices.

## üìΩ üéû And one day...

_In the shadowed silence of a long-abandoned technological building, two explorers, Maya and Eliot, stumble upon a relic of the past‚Äîa dusty, seemingly forsaken laptop. Upon awakening its slumbering screen, they discover a treasure trove of code‚Äîdevelopment work on a sophisticated image processing library designed by two legendary developers, **Gabriel** and **Agustin**, known for their pioneering contributions to computational photography. This library, aimed at mastering the complexities of the Canny edge detection algorithm, could provide invaluable insights into both the past and the future of image analysis._

### Application Description:

The Canny Edge Detection algorithm implemented in this library involves several key steps, each optimized for performance and accuracy. Here is the prototype in C++ for each step:

```cpp
// Pending finish this.

// Divide in classes for each task:
// - satelliteImageWrapper to handle GDAL operations
// - imageFileOperations to store and read files images
// - applyEdgeDetection to encapsulate the Canny Algorithm logic

}
```

Each method in the `CannyEdgeDetector` class corresponds to a step in the Canny edge detection process:

- **applyGaussianBlur**: Smooths the image to reduce noise and detail.
- **findIntensityGradient**: Calculates the gradient of the image's intensity to identify regions with high spatial derivatives.
- **applyNonMaximumSuppression**: Thins edges to ensure that the final image has thin lines.
- **applyHysteresis**: Uses two thresholds to detect strong and weak edges, and includes weak edges only if they are connected to strong edges.

## Tasks to Implement

- **Complete the Code**: Ensure all methods are correctly implemented and optimize for performance.
- **Document the Code**: Provide detailed comments and usage instructions within the codebase and create an accompanying markdown documentation.
- **Test (E2E)**: Implement end-to-end testing to validate the functionality of the edge detection under various scenarios and image conditions.

By fulfilling these tasks, "The Luck is on Our Side" aims to not only revive a piece of forgotten technology but to propel it into the future, helping users rediscover and utilize the power of visual data through the lens of advanced edge detection.
