# H.P.CPP (Hope. Programming. CPP)

## 🎯 Objectives

The main objective of this laboratory is to train students in the efficient design and implementation of computer vision algorithms using High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques. Participants are expected to acquire advanced knowledge of task parallelism, specifically through the use of OpenMP and C++ standard parallelism, and to be capable of properly profiling their applications. Furthermore, students are required to transform the tasks from the previous lab, "Development of Monitoring Application for Resistance", refactor the client-server model from C to C++, efficiently integrating HPC concepts to enhance performance.

## 📝 Evaluation Aspects

1. **Efficient Algorithm Design and Development:**
   - Design and implementation of algorithms that leverage High-Performance Computing capabilities, with a focus on task parallelism using OpenMP.

2. **Accurate Application Profiling:**
   - Precise profiling of developed applications, identifying and addressing potential bottlenecks to improve computational efficiency.

3. **Migration from Client-Server Model to C++:**
   - Successful transition from the C-based client-server model to C++, ensuring the proper integration of HPC concepts to enhance operational performance.

4. **Validation and Performance Testing:**
   - Performance testing to validate the effectiveness of HPC implementations, emphasizing significant improvements in execution speed.

5. **Technical Documentation and Critical Evaluation:**
   - Preparation of technical documentation that provides clear and detailed explanations of the decisions made during implementation, along with a critical evaluation of the impact of HPC techniques on the overall performance of applications.

This laboratory aims to equip students with advanced HPC skills, enabling them to address complex computational problems efficiently and apply these techniques in practical and relevant contexts.

## 📽 🎞 There is hope...

*In the remnants of a once-majestic civilization, humanity grapples with the shadow cast by an unyielding fungal infection. Joel, a leader etched with the scars of both loss and survival, finds himself standing at the pivotal junction of guiding the resistance within an underground sanctuary. Formerly a thriving industrial hub, this refuge now stands as the ultimate stronghold against the metamorphosis of the populace into hostile entities. The control room, transformed into a crucible of uncertainty, serves as the focal point for Joel's vision: a real-time monitoring application, the final beacon of hope for the resistance.*

*Thanks to the successful development of the real-time monitoring application, the resistance's last hope has come to life. The shelter's once dimly lit corridors now buzz with a renewed sense of purpose and determination. Joel's vision of a real-time monitoring system has become a reality, and it's changing the dynamics within the underground sanctuary.*

*The application has transformed the way survivors perceive their world. No longer shrouded in darkness and uncertainty, the refuge's inhabitants now have access to critical information at their fingertips. They receive real-time updates on the status of the shelter, the latest weather conditions, supply availability, and emergency alerts—all neatly presented in a user-friendly interface.*

*Formerly a thriving industrial hub, the refuge has evolved into the ultimate stronghold against the metamorphosis of the populace into hostile entities. The once-abandoned control room, now the nerve center of the monitoring system, pulsates with activity as dedicated survivors work tirelessly to maintain and improve the application's functionality.*

*Survivors now have a lifeline, a tool that empowers them to make informed decisions, coordinate resources, and respond swiftly to threats. The real-time monitoring application has instilled a newfound sense of unity and purpose among the inhabitants. They face an uncertain future with greater preparation, knowing that they have the technological advantage needed to survive and ultimately reclaim what was lost to the fungal infection. With their real-time monitoring application guiding their path, avoiding spore hotspots and navigating through the labyrinth of the fallen cities, they embark on their most crucial mission yet: to bring back hope, to heal the land, and to forge a future from the ruins of the past*

## 🔑 Application Description

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/diagram.png"/>
</p>

The application, designed as a real-time monitoring and command system for post-apocalyptic refuge management, integrates several advanced technologies to enhance its functionality:
- **Parallelism in Canny Edge Detection**: Utilizes OpenMP to accelerate the convolution operations inherent in Canny Edge Detection, crucial for analyzing images for security and surveillance purposes.
- **Allow to users to download the filter map**: Use the socket wrapper to send a zip file with the filtered image. Allow to users to sent and image and process it.
- **Data Management with [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/)**: The server utilizes RocksDB for storing critical data such as supplies and alerts, ensuring fast access and persistence.
- **REST Handling with [cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) on the Server**: The server leverages cpp-httplib to handle incoming REST requests, providing a lightweight and efficient means to manage HTTP communications.

### 〽️ Bonus

 - When the client application is run for the first time, it should check for the presence of a local SQLite3 database. If the database does not exist, the application must create it and prompt the user to enter a username and password. These credentials should then be stored in the database for future use. On subsequent launches, the application should automatically retrieve and use the credentials from the database to authenticate the user.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as Application
    participant DB as SQLite Database
        A->>DB: Check if database exists
        alt Database does not exist
            DB-->>A: No database
            A->>U: Prompt for username and password
            U->>A: Enter username and password
            A->>DB: Create database
            A->>DB: Store credentials
        else Database exists
            DB-->>A: Fetch credentials
        end
    A->>U: Proceed with authentication
```

 - Use [libbcrypt](https://github.com/rg3/libbcrypt/tree/master) to encrypt the password.
